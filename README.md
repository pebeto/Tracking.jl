## Installation
You can install DearDiary.jl via the Julia package manager:
```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("DearDiary")
```

or from the REPL, type `]add DearDiary`.

## Motivation
Experiment tracking is a crucial aspect of machine learning and data science projects.
It helps you keep track of your experiments, models, hyperparameters, and results.
However, many existing experiment tracking tools are either too complex or not
well-integrated with Julia. This package aims to fill that gap by providing a simple yet
powerful solution specifically designed for Julia users.
